## Risk Assessment
Identify potential blockers, dependencies, and mitigation strategies before beginning work.

### Identified Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TODO: Dependency on external team | Medium | High | Early coordination meeting, clear requirements | TODO: Name |
| TODO: Insufficient test coverage | Low | Medium | Allocate time for test writing in Phase 2 | TODO: Name |

### Dependencies
- **Internal:** TODO: List dependencies on other teams, services, or infrastructure
- **External:** TODO: List dependencies on third-party services, vendors, or partners
- **Technical:** TODO: List technical prerequisites or required upgrades

### Assumptions
- TODO: Document key assumptions being made (e.g., "Assume current API schema remains stable")
- TODO: Note what happens if assumptions prove false

## Resource Estimation

### Time Allocation
| Phase | Estimated Effort | Calendar Time | Team Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 - Discovery | TODO: e.g., 2 person-days | 3-5 days | 1-2 people |
| Phase 2 - Implementation | TODO: e.g., 5 person-days | 1-2 weeks | 2-3 people |
| Phase 3 - Validation | TODO: e.g., 2 person-days | 3-5 days | 1-2 people |
| **Total** | **TODO: total** | **TODO: total** | **-** |

### Required Skills
- TODO: List required expertise (e.g., "React experience", "Database optimization", "Infrastructure knowledge")
- TODO: Identify skill gaps and training needs

### Resource Availability
- **Available:** TODO: List team members and their availability
- **Blocked:** TODO: Note any team members with conflicting priorities
- **Escalation:** TODO: Name of person to contact if resources are insufficient

## Working Phases
### Phase 1 — Discovery & Alignment
**Steps**
1. TODO: Outline discovery tasks and assign the accountable owner.
2. TODO: Capture open questions that require clarification.

**Commit Checkpoint**
- After completing this phase, capture the agreed context and create a commit (for example, `git commit -m "chore(plan): complete phase 1 discovery"`).

### Phase 2 — Implementation & Iteration
**Steps**
1. TODO: Note build tasks, pairing expectations, and review cadence.
2. TODO: Reference docs or playbooks to keep changes aligned.

**Commit Checkpoint**
- Summarize progress, update cross-links, and create a commit documenting the outcomes of this phase (for example, `git commit -m "chore(plan): complete phase 2 implementation"`).

### Phase 3 — Validation & Handoff
**Steps**
1. TODO: Detail testing, verification, and documentation updates.
2. TODO: Document evidence the team must capture for maintainers.

**Commit Checkpoint**
- Record the validation evidence and create a commit signalling the handoff completion (for example, `git commit -m "chore(plan): complete phase 3 validation"`).

## Rollback Plan
Document how to revert changes if issues arise during or after implementation.

### Rollback Triggers
When to initiate rollback:
- Critical bugs affecting core functionality
- Performance degradation beyond acceptable thresholds
- Data integrity issues detected
- Security vulnerabilities introduced
- User-facing errors exceeding alert thresholds

### Rollback Procedures
#### Phase 1 Rollback
- Action: Discard discovery branch, restore previous documentation state
- Data Impact: None (no production changes)
- Estimated Time: < 1 hour

#### Phase 2 Rollback
- Action: TODO: Revert commits, restore database to pre-migration snapshot
- Data Impact: TODO: Describe any data loss or consistency concerns
- Estimated Time: TODO: e.g., 2-4 hours

#### Phase 3 Rollback
- Action: TODO: Full deployment rollback, restore previous version
- Data Impact: TODO: Document data synchronization requirements
- Estimated Time: TODO: e.g., 1-2 hours

### Post-Rollback Actions
1. Document reason for rollback in incident report
2. Notify stakeholders of rollback and impact
3. Schedule post-mortem to analyze failure
4. Update plan with lessons learned before retry

## Evidence & Follow-up

List artifacts to collect (logs, PR links, test runs, design notes). Record follow-up actions or owners.
